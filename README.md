Guess who's learning about github use...!

So, when I was a kid, I was friends with a girl who lived on a street that ran around ours, so the backyards almost met. But it was a long walk from front door to front door on the streets. So, despite our parents objections, we would often push our way through the cedar hedge and hop the chain-link fences to visit each other. "Fences" plural, because our yards didn't actually touch, and you had to cut through another neighbour's yard to get between the two.
